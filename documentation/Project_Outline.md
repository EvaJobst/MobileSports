# Project Idea

##### Idea Collection
- Like Runtastic - but with mountain climbing (_Climbtastic_)
- Heart-Rate, covered km, covered height (m), start/stop (time, time of the tour), burned calories, statistics, weather (weather warning, bad weather warning during or at the beginning of a tour), pedometer, respiration
- Database -> Firebase
- (maybe: showing the current speed; showing the wanted speed for a tour)
- (maybe: Garmin-Integration)
- Service

##### Activities
- CurrentTourActivity (MainActivity)
  - NoCurrentTour: Weather, Current Respiration, Current Pulse, Time of Start, Time since Start, burned Calories, Steps taken
- TourOverviewActivity
- TourDetailActivity
